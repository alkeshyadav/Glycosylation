# Glycosylation
This repository contains the code and data used in the paper - "Glycan processing in the Golgi : optimal information coding and constraints on cisternal number and  enzyme specificity"


The folders 'Diversity', 'Hessian_calculation', 'MS_profile_analyis', 'optimization_B' contains the codes for doing the respective calculations/optimizations. 
The results of these optimization/calculations as well as the Mass Spec data are in the 'Data' folder. 

The 'Plotting _scripts' folder contains all the plotting scripts used to generate the plots in the paper. They are organised in folders labeled by the figure index in the paper. 

The matlab package 'DERIVESTsuite' by John D'Errico was used in the  hessian calculation and the matlab package 'cbrewer' by Charles Robert was used in choosing colors for the plots.
